## Overview

This guide provides a complete step-by-step process for deploying **NutriTrack**—an automated AI nutrition tracking and image analysis system on AWS. The workshop leverages the **AWS Amplify Gen 2** governance framework to establish a core serverless infrastructure including **Amazon Cognito** (Authentication), **AWS AppSync** & **DynamoDB** (Data), and **Amazon S3** (Storage). The system is extended with a high-performance computing layer using **Amazon ECS Fargate** to handle computer vision tasks and in-depth nutrition analysis via **Amazon Bedrock**, seamlessly connecting to the **React Native** mobile application. The entire solution incorporates an automated **CI/CD** process, optimizing deployment from development to actual operation in the cloud environment.

## What You Will Learn

- Design and deploy a full-stack AWS application using modern cloud services
- Implement serverless architecture with AWS Amplify Gen 2
- Set up authentication with Amazon Cognito
- Build GraphQL APIs with AWS AppSync and DynamoDB
- Deploy containerized applications with ECS Fargate
- Integrate AI services using Amazon Bedrock
- Establish CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment
- Optimize costs and manage cloud resources effectively

## Requirements

- AWS Account with administrator access
- Basic knowledge of AWS services and cloud computing
- Experience with React Native development
- Understanding of containerization and Docker
- Familiarity with CI/CD concepts
